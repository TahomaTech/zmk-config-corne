# ZMK Configuration - Corne - [![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/TahomaTech/zmk-config-corne/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TahomaTech/zmk-config-corne/actions/workflows/build.yml)
This is the [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) configuration for my [Corne V3](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard.

## Installation
Installing the firmware onto a Corne requires you to connect the Corne to your PC, double click the reset button, and dragging/dropping the compiled file into the proper side.

## Usage
The firmware for the Corne is built from GitHub actions. By cloning/forking the repo and having GitHub actions run, you will have the compiled firmware for each side of the Corne.
