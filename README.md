# ZMK Configuration - Corne - [![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/TahomaTech/zmk-config-corne/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/TahomaTech/zmk-config-corne/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is my [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) configuration for my [Corne V3](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard.

## Installation
Installing the firmware onto a Corne requires you to download the firmware artifact from the "Actions" tab, connect the Corne to your PC, enter bootloader mode (double click the reset button or dedicated button on existing firmware), and dragging/dropping the compiled file into the proper side.

## Usage
The firmware for the Corne is built from GitHub actions. By cloning/forking the repo and having GitHub actions run, you will have the compiled firmware for each side of the Corne. Alternatively you can download the firmware I use [here](https://github.com/TahomaTech/zmk-config-corne/actions).
